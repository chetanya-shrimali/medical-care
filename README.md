Project Introduction-

Medi-Care is a web app which provides a list of best hospitals in a locality on the basis of some datas received by the users.

### Project Proposal

Most of the time what happens is the people residing in rural area or far away from cities, have to face a lot of problems to search for the best hospitals as per their needs. This is because they usually don't have any prior information about the hospitals. So in case they visit wrong hospitals, then it leads the wastage of money and the most impotant time, but could not get better result.

To overcome this kind of problems, we came up with an idea to create a website which can provide a list of best hospitals as per the requirements like affordable hospital charge, nearby to the resident of patients.

### Features

1. It can find the best hospital in a particular area.
2. It can provide information about doctors and hospitals.
3. User or People visited to a particular hospital can review and rate it on the basis of his/her experience about the hospital facilities so that it can help others    to identify better hospital.
